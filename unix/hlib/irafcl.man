.SH NAME
IRAFCL \- IRAF Command Language Interpreter
.SH SYNOPSIS
irafcl [\fB\,\-V\fR|\fB\-c\fR|\fB\-e\/\fR] [\fB\,-f \fIFILE\/\fR]

ecl [\fB\,\-V\fR|\fB\-c\fR|\fB\-e\/\fR] [\fB\,-f \fIFILE\/\fR]

cl [\fB\,\-V\fR|\fB\-c\fR|\fB\-e\/\fR] [\fB\,-f \fIFILE\/\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBirafcl\fR, \fBecl\fR or \fBcl\fR starts up the command language
interpreter for IRAF, the Image Reduction and Analysis Facility.  It
can be fed a series of commands that will be executed in sequence.

The ECL (Enhanced CL) has a number of features over CL, including
better error handling, command line editing, new functions and
constants. Unless for compatibility reasons, ECL should be used over
CL.

Because the names \fBecl\fR and \fBcl\fR conflict with other commonly
used command names for Common Lisp, the canonical name of the
interpreter is \fBirafcl\fR, which defaults to \fBECL\fR behaviour.
